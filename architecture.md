# Architecture and Development Strategy for AI-Driven Expansion

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a strategic plan to evolve the project's architecture for rapid, scalable, and reliable development, with a strong emphasis on leveraging AI assistants. The goal is to establish a robust foundation that supports a fast "feature -> implementation -> test -> deploy" cycle while maintaining system integrity as complexity grows.

The core philosophy is to make every part of the system explicit, typed, and machine-readable.

## 2. Current State Analysis

The project is a TODO application with a Node.js/Express TypeScript backend, a TypeScript frontend, and supports multiple storage backends (file, memory, PostgreSQL).

### ✅ Implemented Strengths:
- **Complete TypeScript Migration:** Entire codebase migrated to TypeScript with full type safety
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** The backend code is well-structured into `services`, `controllers`, `routes`, and `validators`.
- **Robust Validation:** Use of `zod` for schema validation with TypeScript type inference
- **Comprehensive Testing:** 100% test coverage with Playwright for both API and UI tests (35/35 tests passing)
- **Production Testing:** Live production environment testing with automated data clearing
- **Decoupled Frontend:** TypeScript frontend with separate compilation pipeline
- **Modern Tooling:** TypeScript, ESLint, and build automation ensures code quality
- **Automated Deployment:** Vercel deployment pipeline working with TypeScript source

### Remaining Opportunities:
1.  **Manual CI/CD Process:** GitHub Actions automation not yet implemented
2.  **Complex Environment Setup:** Still uses manual environment management (could benefit from containerization)
3.  **Living Requirements System:** Feature documentation could be more structured

## 3. Strategic Proposals

Here are the remaining pillars for building a scalable, AI-friendly architecture.

### ✅ Pillar 1: Living Requirements System (COMPLETED)

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

A complete "Living Requirements" system is now in place providing structured, machine-readable documentation.

**What's Implemented:**
- **Feature Files**: 4 comprehensive feature files covering all functionality
  - `001-todo-crud.feature.md` - API CRUD operations (10 scenarios)
  - `002-ui-todo.feature.md` - UI functionality (14 scenarios)
  - `003-ui-accessibility.feature.md` - Accessibility (8 scenarios)
  - `004-ui-responsive.feature.md` - Responsive design (3 scenarios)
- **Total Coverage**: 35 scenarios with 100% test linkage
- **Automated Verification**: TypeScript script (`scripts/verify-test-coverage.ts`)
- **CI Integration**: Built into `npm test` workflow
- **Standalone Verification**: `npm run verify:requirements` command

**Benefits Achieved:**
- **AI-Friendly**: Machine-readable Given-When-Then format
- **Bidirectional Traceability**: Features ↔ Tests ↔ Code
- **Automated Enforcement**: Build fails if requirements lack test coverage  
- **Living Documentation**: Requirements synchronized with functionality

**Usage:**
```bash
npm test                    # Run tests + verify coverage
npm run verify:requirements # Verify coverage only
```

**Results:** 35/35 scenarios passing with perfect traceability

### Pillar 2: Unify and Simplify the Development Environment

**Problem:** The current environment setup is complex and platform-dependent.

**Proposal:** Use `podman-compose` to manage all services (app, database) and consolidate environment variables.

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Create `compose.yml`:**
    ```yaml
    version: '3.8'
    services:
      app:
        build: .
        ports:
          - "3000:3000"
        depends_on:
          - db
        environment:
          - NODE_ENV=development
          - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db:5432/todos
      db:
        image: postgres:15
        restart: always
        environment:
          - POSTGRES_USER=user
          - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
          - POSTGRES_DB=todos
        ports:
          - "5432:5432"
        volumes:
          - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

    volumes:
      postgres_data:
    ```
2.  **Create `.env.example`:** A template for all required environment variables.
3.  **Update `package.json` scripts:** Replace manual scripts with `podman-compose` commands.

### Pillar 3: Automate the Full CI/CD Cycle

**Problem:** The feedback loop could be faster with automated CI/CD.

**Proposal:** Implement a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically tests and deploys every push to `main`.

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Create a GitHub Actions Workflow:**
    *File: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`*
    ```yaml
    name: CI/CD Pipeline

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ main ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]

    jobs:
      test:
        name: Run Tests
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            with:
              node-version: '18'
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm install
          - name: Install Playwright browsers
            run: npx playwright install --with-deps
          - name: Run Playwright tests
            run: npm test

      deploy:
        name: Deploy to Vercel
        needs: test
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' && github.event_name == 'push'
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v3
          - name: Deploy to Vercel
            uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v20
            with:
              vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
              vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
              vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
    ```
2.  **Configure Secrets:** Add `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` to your GitHub repository secrets.
