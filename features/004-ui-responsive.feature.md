# Feature: TODO UI Responsive Layout

ID: 004
As a: user on different devices
I want to: use the application seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop
So that: I can manage todos from any device size

## Scenario: Mobile viewport functionality
Given I use a mobile sized viewport
When I load the application and add a todo
Then input, add button, and newly added todo should display correctly

Test file: `tests/ui/responsive.spec.js`
Test name: `should work on mobile viewport`

## Scenario: Tablet viewport with multiple todos
Given I use a tablet sized viewport
When I add two todos
Then both should appear in the list

Test file: `tests/ui/responsive.spec.js`
Test name: `should work on tablet viewport`

## Scenario: Desktop viewport full functionality
Given I use a desktop sized viewport
When I add a todo and open then cancel delete modal
Then layout renders container, title, and modal interactions work
